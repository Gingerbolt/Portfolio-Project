        <h2>About Me</h2>


        <p>
          Just the same old story of the kid who wanted to do some good and studied an area that would not further that goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following acquiring my degree in criminology and my subsequent distaste for retributive justice I discovered that I could communicate well. So I became a salesman for a spell.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sold plenty of insurance until the time came for my clients to use the policies I had sold them and the insurance company found ways to keep from paying out. I'd found another way to hurt people through my work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I concluded that I would need to do the work myself. So I began to work for a landscaping company, taught myself and got full pesticide and herbicide certifications within a month. The work was satisfying. Eventually I had to move on because I felt the effects of pesticide over-exposure.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew that I needed to do my own work but I wanted to work in conjunction with a team. I knew I needed to do good. So another three months on and I had a certification as a residential energy analyst. Within six months I had a new job with a small company.
        </p>
        <p>
          That job didn't last long because the company was unable to get enough sales to pay me a living wage. I got a new job, this time for the money.
        </p>
        <p>
          I became a debt collector, working with the worst cases. I saved hundreds of people's homes and improved their lives all while making a tidy sum from the company. The work was temporary however, it eventually came to an end.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the upside my newfound freedom allowed me to dive into working in politics. It was there that I really learned that my creativity needs to get out. I was given voter turnout goals and told to achieve them. Utilizing resources from across the state we worked to make calls into Nevada at a rate that has never been seen in any prior elections. Training and guiding the phone volunteers was a particular strength, they would always come back when I trained them say it was because I explained so well. The election ended and it's been like a treadmill I was on suddenly stopped.
        </p>
        <p>
          That leaves me throwing my momentum here. Knowing I need to do my own work, and knowing that I thrive with a team, programming seems to be the perfect fit.
